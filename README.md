===============
Frank Hu and Charles Brookes July 11, File Explorer for First Friday Hackathon Athens, GA

Use left, right, up, and down to move the screen to see more circles.
Press A to move all the way back to the left.
Press Z to go all the way back up.

Left click on folders to open them.
Right click to close the last opened directory.

This file explorer will only open files that have an associated manager, else it will not work correctly. (Undefined Behavior, use this program WITH CAUTION)

Folders and files are displayed relative to their size, the circles are capped to a max and min size so as to make their sizes reasonable.
